                  Simple Symbolic Mathematics for Scala

           A demonstration of different programming paradigms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains a very simple, and incomplete symbolic maths library in 
Scala. The library is implemented three times with different paradigms:

* Functional, with pattern matching. 
* Classical object oriented.
* Object oriented with the Visitor pattern.

Features
--------

* Evaluation of mathematical expressions with known and unknown variables.
* Differentiation of expressions.
* A very simple internal DSL.
